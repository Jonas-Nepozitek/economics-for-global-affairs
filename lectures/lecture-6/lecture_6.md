# Comparative Advantage and Industrial Policy

## Empirical model of CA

- Revealed CA: $RCA_p$
  - p: product
  - c: country
  - $x_{cp}$: the exports of p by c

- $RCA_p=\frac{x_{cp}/\sum_c{x_{cp}}}{\sum_p{x_{cp}}/\sum_c\sum_px_{cp}}$

  - **Numerator**: country's exports of products / world's exports of products
  - **Denominator**: country's total exports / world's total exports
  - A higher value implies a stronger comparative advantage
    - Conventionally, a country has CA in a product if RCA>1, but the threshold of 1 is arbitrary
  - It would be better to look at production instead of exports, but finding that data for the whole world is impossible. Therefore, using export data is much better, as it's better recorded
    - Also might be impacted by subsidies
    - Lastly, doesn't tell us about a possible CA
  - Always relevant in a relative sense (compared in time or with other products)

## First welfare theorem

- Assumptions:
  - Perfectly competitive market
  - No information asymmetry between buyers and sellers
  - No externalities
- Under those assumptions, the markets will maximize utility and will be efficient
  - Policymakers won't achieve a better outcome
  - Economists do no advocate intervention
