## Adverse selection

- Without govt intervention and due to information asymmetries, markets will not be efficient

## Industrial policy

- Makes sense during market inefficiencies or if there is inequitable distribution
- When one of these assumptions is violated:
  - Perfectly competitive market
  - No information asymmetry between buyers and sellers
  - No externalities
- Present in distorted economies
  - Workers are credit/information constrained
  - Firms with monopoly/monopsony powers
  - Productivity spillovers
- Static forces: Marshallian externalities
  - Labor market pooling
  - Specialized inputs
  - Knowledge spillovers
- Dynamic forces
  - Infant industry protection
- Pol econ concerns
  - Credible estimates of gamma for all sectors
  - How to verify the revenues and costs of firms in order to compute optimal subsidy
  - How to prevent firm B claiming they're firm A
  - How to prevent rent-seeking lobbying (and political capture)
