# TFP

- Sources of TFP: endogenous and exogenous
- Recombinant growth (Weitzman 1998): TFP growth by recombining existing ideas

## Globalization as a driver of productivity

- Productivity can increase by getting rid of less productive firms (selection)
- Purely being exposed to more ideas/competition encourages you/enables you to be more efficient (treatment)
- Selection/Treatment as a good way of analyzing any policy

- Pareto improvement: a policy that leaves everyone at least the same as they were before

- Export can raise profits, product quality, and even productivity (due to information flows from clients to intermediaries to producers on how to improve the product)
