# Lecture 2

## Conditional convergence

- Convergence within regions or dividing by secondary education, time, etc.

## Development accounting

- Output per input: notion of efficiency
- Production function (Cobb-Douglass): $Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$
  - A: Total factor productivity
    - Given the same inputs, one country might have more output than another
    - Tech progress, organizational know-how, innovation
    - Non-rival component production (multiple people can use it)
- If we ignore some factors, TFP may reflect factors like education, land, energy, etc.
- Output per person: $\frac{Y}{L}=A(\frac{K^\alpha}{L^\alpha})$
  - $y=Ak^\alpha$
    - y = output per worker
    - k = capital per worker
    - A = TFP
  - $y=Ak^{0.3}$
    - Exhibits diminishing returns to capital
    - No diminishing returns to TFP (constant returns)
  - $\ln{y}=\ln{a}$
